# Messsing-with-Cryptography
This repository contains some attempts at cryptographic encryptions and decryptions.

Originally, most of the content was a part of an applied cryptography course that I was taking.
Unfortunately, I had to drop the course due to having such a tight schedule and not being able
to handle work and 17 credits at the same time.

I didn't want my code to go to waste, so I thought sharing it here would be useful.

Note: The assignments were origianlly meant to be attempted with Java, however I decided
to procede using python.
